## üîî Real-time Notifications

The web client connects to the WebSocket server using `useSocket`. When you pass
the connected user's ID to `useNotifications` (which forwards it to `useSocket`),
the hook automatically joins the `user_<userId>` room and listens for
`notification` events. The server sends these events when commands like
`inviteToWorkspace` or `inviteToChannel` create a new invite, so any user
subscribed with `useSocket(undefined, userId)` receives the notification
instantly.
